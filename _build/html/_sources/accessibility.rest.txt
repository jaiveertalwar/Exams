Accessibility support
-------------------------------------
Things I've heard have better than average accessibility support:

Text Editors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Emacs
~~~~~~~~~~

Emacspeak
~~~~~~~~~~~~
| Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacspeak

GUI Toolkits
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Qt
~~~
From http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/accessible.html :

    [...] Semantic information about user interface elements, such as buttons and scroll bars, is exposed to the assistive technologies. Qt supports Microsoft Active Accessibility (MSAA) and IAccessible2 on Windows, OS X Accessibility on OS X, and AT-SPI via DBus on Unix/X11. The platform specific technologies are abstracted by Qt, so that applications do not need any platform specific changes to work with the different native APIs. Qt tries to make adding accessibility support to your application as easy as possible, only a few changes from your side may be required to allow even more users to enjoy it. [...]


Gnome
~~~~~~~

Languages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Python
~~~~~~~~~~

* `Emacspeak`_ has support for {, python, IDLE,}
* IPython / Jupyter
* IPython in a terminal
* IPython qtconsole (`Qt`_ toolkit)
* Spyder IDE (`Qt`_ toolkit) embeds an IPython console with a Run button and lightweight code completion: https://code.google.com/p/spyderlib/

- [ ]  Jupyter Notebook may / should have `WAI-ARIA`_ role tags (which are really easy to add to most templates)


Content Management Systems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Plone
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
| Wikipedia: `<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plone_(software)>`__

From https://plone.org/accessibility-info :

  **Accessibility**
  This site uses the open source Content Management System Plone. It meets the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (`WCAG v2.0 <http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/>`_) level 'AA' for people with disabilities, including blindness and low vision, deafness and hearing loss, learning disabilities, cognitive limitations, limited movement, speech disabilities, photosensitivity, and combinations of these.

  It is also accessible to content authors with disabilities per the level 'AA' Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (`ATAG 2.0 <http://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/>`_).

  **Accessibility Statement**
  This site was designed to accommodate the different ways people access and use the Internet.

  **Validation**
  The site uses assistive technology like WAI-ARIA roles to the current best practices; however, site standards and content vary over time. If this web site does not validate correctly, please contact the Site Administration.

  A number of checkpoints in WCAG 2.0 and ATAG 2.0 guidelines are subjective; there may be instances where interpretations vary

Accessible Markup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- ARIA tags (role, properties

Lightweight Markup Languages:

- Markdown
- ReStructuredText
- {..., Textile, BBCode}

"Eyestrain, Computers, The 20 -20–20 rule, Light bulb APIs"
============================================================
| BlogPost: https://medium.com/@westurner/the-20-20-20-rule-1fc591155a28

The 20–20–20 rule:
-------------------
Every **20 minutes**,
look at something at least **20 ft** (*6.09m*) away,
for at least like **20 seconds**.

Computer glasses
------------------
(to reduce glare and eyestrain):

- gaming glasses (e.g. the Gunnar tint and coating (http://www.gunnars.com/faq/) can be found at e.g. Best Buy (where they are known to carry e.g. Gunnar Intercept computer gaming eyewear glasses frames))
- safety glasses (can often buy in bulk)
- nosepads (replaceable)
- nosepads (built-in)
- glasses measurements (mm)

  - temple measurement
  - vertical/frame height
  - eye_size*2 + bridge size ~= width

Monitor adjustments
----------------------
(to reduce glare and eyestrain):

- brightness/contrast
- lighten the blue channel (*)
- good monitor stands support vertical tilt

Monitor settings
-------------------
Tools that gradually modify monitor settings to match the natural solar cycle:

- f.lux (http://justgetflux.com) — Linux, Mac, Windows, iOS
- Twilight (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.urbandroid.lux) — Android

Browser extensions
-------------------
Browser extensions for modifying style attributes:

- brightness
- contrast
- background
- text color
- inverting just the CSS colors

— https://westurner.github.io/tools/#browser-extensions

  - Deluminate -- https://westurner.github.io/tools/#deluminate
  - Stylish ( http://userstyles.org/ )
  - High Contrast -- https://westurner.github.io/tools/#high-contrast
  
- Disadvantages:

  1. These sometimes cause hiccups (easily diagnosable by unchecking the extension(s) and CTRL-R refreshing the current tab)     
  2. If the browser colors are inverted AND the whole screen is inverted, there’s probably a less contrasty CSS styleset


System high contrast / color inversion:
-------------------------------------------------

    {“settings”, "config", "control panel"} -> { “appearance” , “accessibility” }


X11, Xorg, Gnome, Linux, BSD, Unix
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Compiz color filters (e.g. negative-red, negative-red-dim)

  - https://github.com/westurner/dotfiles/tree/master/etc/compiz/colorfilters)

- xgamma, xbacklight, xrandr, xflux

  - https://github.com/westurner/dotfiles/blob/master/etc/i3/config


Dark window manager themes
-----------------------------
- Windows: WindowBlinds, Win7+
- Ubuntu 10.04+
- Gnome 3: [dnf install -y] gnome-tweak-tool > “Appearance” > ”Global dark theme”
- OSX 10.10 Yosemite “Dark Mode”

[Blue] Light affects sleep (/alertness):


.. pullquote:
   […] experimental research suggests that
   an average person reading on a tablet for a couple hours before bed
   may find that their sleep is delayed by about an hour.
   --  https://justgetflux.com/research.html
   
.. note:: Complementary color lenses filter the opposite wavelength(s);
   so lellow-ish lenses block blue light.
   Probably because the ocean sounds.

   [I think] red light is easier to accommodate to in the dark.

Lightbulbs
-------------
Features for Multicolor LED [Bluetooth] light bulbs:

- adjustable (spectrum; millions of colors)
- gradual wake-up alarmable (n min)
- gradual dim (~30min)
- API: Continuous Integration build lamp, AV, HVAC
- Hub / Hubless (1[+] registered mobile)
- API: Digital (Voice) Assistant
- API: RESTful JSON[-LD] LDP URIs
- API: HTTP WAMP sensor swarm
- (Open Source) Web Interface
- Phillips Hue (http://meethue.com/en-us/products/)
- Misfit Bolt (http://misfit.com/products/bolt)

Font Antialiasing
--------------------
- System font ”smoothing”; LCD
- System FXAA full-screen Antialiasing
- GUI toolkit antialiasing configuration::
  
   TODO: GIF


Font Size
------------

- System DPI (dots per inch)
- System base font size (px pixels)
- [GTK,Qt,Win] Application font size (px)
- Browser base font size (before e.g. a reset.css) (px,pt,em)
- Site CSS font styles (px,pt,em)

    
Keyboard Shortcuts
--------------------
- Increase font size:

  - CTRL + +
  - CTRL + ScrollUp

- Decrease font size:
